# pipex
  pipex: reproduce the shell's pipe 
  
### Discription of mandatory part
The program ```pipex``` should repeat the behaviour of the next shell command

```c
 < file1 cmd1 | cmd2 > file2 
 ```

and looks like this:

```c
./pipex file1 cmd1 cmd2 file2 
```

All errors like: wrong commands, permission to files and etc, need be handle.
